 THERE ARE 2 BACKENDSS
 1-> DATABASE
 2-> WEBSERVICES EXTERNAL API
 
 When do we call the sequential calls?
 -> If we want some data from 1 backend but second backend is dependent on first backend then only 2nd backend will give the response
 	Ifwe want to communicate with 2 backend system if 1 backend is dependent on another backend then we should go for sequential calls.
 	
 	Here 1st backend response(O/p) would be 2nd backend(I/p) request.
 	If 1st backend down or giving errors then we cannot call 2nd backend.
 	Overall response will be error response
 	
 	If 1st backend success and 2nd backend gives error then depends upon client requirement 
 		a. send first backend (partial response) to client and ignore the second backend response.
 		b. dont send partial response, send as it is to client.

 	If we want to connect with more than 1 backend systems and all these systems are not dependent on each other
